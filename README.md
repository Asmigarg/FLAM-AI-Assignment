## Seamless Person Integration into a Scene
The objective of this assignment is to implement a step-by-step process to place a person into a given scene and seamlessly blend them to make the result look photorealistic. The key steps include:

1. Capturing a high-quality image of a person
2. Removing the background
3. Analyzing the background image for lighting and shadows
4. Estimating light direction (for indoor and outdoor scenes)
5. Coloring and blending the person to match the scene
6. Generating a final output image where the person is naturally integrated into the background

The goal is to ensure that:
1. Lighting and shadows are correctly aligned
2. Colors between the person and the background are seamless
3. The result looks realistic
   
No code is required to be submitted â€” only the final composite image and algorithm documentation.
